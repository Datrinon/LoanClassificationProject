# Bondora Loan Classification Project
Finished in May 2021.
By Dan Trinh, Abhishek Yenumula, Singer Li, and Brandon Nguyen.

A group project for data mining at Cal Poly Pomona in which we analyzed a dataset from online lending platform Bondora to see if we could build a classification model that could identify defaults based on given registration data. The outcome was a Random Forest model which could correctly identify ~67% of defaults.

**We used Python, pandas, and scikit-learn for this project.**

We selected the platform because their registration database is easily accessible through a download on their website.
